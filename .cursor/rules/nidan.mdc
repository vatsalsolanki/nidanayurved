Nidan Ayurved Website: Project Rules & Guidelines

1. Multilingual Structure
- Default language is English (/) â€” do not use /en in URLs.
- Hindi (/hi/) and Gujarati (/gu/) are under their respective subpaths.
- All text must use translation keys (never hardcoded), even in the default language.
- All dynamic content (e.g., treatments) must be available in all languages via static JSON files.

2. Directory & File Organization
- Each page (static or dynamic) must have its own folder under /app/.
- Section components for each page must be placed in their respective page folders (e.g., /app/about-us/AboutHero.tsx).
- Dynamic treatment pages: Each treatment is a separate folder under /app/treatments/[slug]/ with its own components.

3. Design & Theming
- Use the provided color palette and font families for each language.
- Fonts: Use next/font/google and apply via CSS variables based on the active locale.
- Tailwind: Use the provided config for colors and font families.

4. Animations
- Use Framer Motion for all page transitions and key UI elements (e.g., cards, modals, section reveals).

5. SEO & Metadata
- Use generateMetadata() in every page to set localized meta tags (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter).
- Ensure all metadata is language-specific.

6. Header, Footer, and Navigation
- Header and Footer must be fully multilingual and update links/content based on the active language.
- Language Switcher: Must update the URL and UI language without redirecting English to /en.

7. Forms
- Use React Hook Form for all forms (e.g., contact, appointment).

8. Responsiveness & Accessibility
- All pages and components must be fully responsive and accessible (ARIA, keyboard navigation, etc.).

9. Code Quality
- No hardcoded text: Always use translation keys.
- Clean, modular, and maintainable code.
- No unused files or boilerplate.

10. Deployment
- The project must be ready for deployment on Cloudflare (no platform-specific code for Vercel/Netlify).

Always check every new page, component, or feature against these rules before considering it complete.
